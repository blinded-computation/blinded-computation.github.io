Formal model of BliME
=====================

We here document the machine-checked proof of security of the `BliMe <https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09649>`_ taint-tracking policy.

You will find the model itself `on Github <https://github.com/ssg-research/BliMe>`_

You can also find the slides from a talk on this model `here <https://lachlan.gunn.ee/slides/2023-08-22%20Blime-FStar.pdf>`_.
